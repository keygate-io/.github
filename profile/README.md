* [`mpc-multisig-wasm`](https://github.com/alloy-rs/core): Core smart account to sign transactions in different blockchains using a single smart account hosted on the Internet Computer Protocol.
* [`vault`](https://github.com/keygate-io/vault): A dashboard to manage assets across multiple blockchains, written in Motoko. Succeeded by DFINITY's [Orbit](https://orbit.global/).
